# Justin Gast's test from BYU OIT.
Assumptions: from what was required i figured i would try and do it in nodeJS. I have never used nodeJS before but know vanilla javascript pretty well as well as jquery & JSON. With that i went and tried to use a npm library known as github.js to interact with github. Some ofit worked great and then it seemed as if the functions didn't exist or something i had done wrong. Also to a point you emailed me this test the day before i was to go on vacation and am getting back on the day this is due. Just bad timing on my part i guess :)

to run it: make sure you have nodejs installe and open a command prompt. in the command prompt head to the folder where the app.js file is that you got from the git porject and run "node app.js"(it will probably fail but that is as far as i got)

Conclusion: this was a fun exercise i got to play with a language i have never used and it worked to an extent in a small period of time during a planned vacation was a bit challenging though.

Thank you for this opportunity
